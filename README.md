# Wordhelper

Rails 8 app that solves anagrams. The word list is taken from the dictionary found on most Unix-based systems in `/usr/share/dict/words`.

This was created in frustration when I was looking for anagram solvers online, and all the ones I found were so bogged down with ads as to render them unusable.
